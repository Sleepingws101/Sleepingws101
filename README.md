- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael Duke
This README is purely for an assignment assigned by SNHU

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
   The project was essentially to create an application that would track the inventory of a store and then allow the user to input an item the store may have to check if it is in stock, and how many were in stock.

2. What did you do particularly well?
   I'm not sure if I could pick one particular thing based on this project but I can say I was satisfied with the looping mechanics I had incorperated into my project.
   
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   One thing that was bugging me about the coding structure I had created was that my main menu input only asked for an integer, and could only receive integers from the user without causing an endless loop. Since that wasn't a condition made within the instructions of the assignment, I left this alone. However, if this was a task provided by a real company I would have obviously adjusted this to allow for other inputs to prevent frustration by the user due to user error.

4. Which pieces of code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
   Well I didn't really add any tools or resources other than the include modules I added, I am curious what other tools are resources would even be avaliable to me for things like this. The thing I struggled with the most was probably the looping system. I've always had at least some difficulty with this concept because I found that it is difficult to make adjustments to it without also sometimes completely restructuring certain parts of the code, depending on how it is written.
   That being said, I learned I have to be more mindful of how I structure my code while considering its functions and potential future functions as the code progresses.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
   Essentially most, if not all, of the skills will carry over well with future courses and work within SNHU since I've noticed a lot of the content for Computer Science can be redundant in many aspects. Especially since each software developemnt program has at least some overlapping content.

6. How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   I achieved each of these things by keeping in my what the user and the customer want. I assessed the task and what the underlining needs would be and worked out step by step how to deliver what was needed. I find that this is best done by compartmentalization but this would also depend on exactly what is being developed, the length of the project and also future updates for the code.
